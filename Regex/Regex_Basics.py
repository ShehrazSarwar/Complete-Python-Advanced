# Since we have a special meaning of special character \ --> (use for escape sequences)
# The solution is to use Pythonâ€™s raw string notation for regular expression patterns
# Inorder to let compiler know that don't check for any syntax error for \ or \\

pattern = r"\d{10}|\(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}"
# here \d used to check for any digit and {Any Count} for more than one count checking!
print(re.search(pattern,txt))  # return starting and ending index position with match pattern

matches = re.findall(pattern,txt)  # return list of all possible matched found from the string
